    <p> Our project was inspired by the vast array of wines avaiable when one visits a grocery store. As a group, we have always wanted to know where the best wines come from. In order to aid in our curiosity,
      we located a <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews"> dataset</a> compliled by Zach Thoutt, which he scraped from <a href = "https://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine"> Winemag.com</a>. This site
      contains a collection of reviews collected from wine experts all over the globe. For each of the 130,000+ reviews, there is information about the name of the wine; the country, province, vineyard, and winery the wine is from;
      the points (out of 100) that the taster rated the wine; and the price ($) of the wine. The first thing we wanted to explore was the overall average rating of wines across the globe. </p>

      <p> After exploring the data from a global standpoint, we wanted to take a more local approach and look closer at the United States. We created a dynamic bar chart that allows the user to view the average price
        of wines per state, as well as the average number of points per state. Selecting the "Points" option from the dropdown will display the average points for each state. Selecting the "Price" option from the dropdown
        provides the average price per state. Furthermore, the user can check the "Sort Values" box checkbox at the bottom of the visualization. Depending on the attribute selected, the average points or price
        will appear in descending order.</p>

    <p> As seen in the previous visualization, Texas was located in the middle of the pack for both the average price and points. We wanted to explore this state more as we hoped it would provide a varied dataset
      with both expensive high quality wines and cheeper low quality ones. From this graph, we want the user to be able to identify the best quality wine in their price range.
