Heather: Cleaned all of the data in R in preparation to create the visualizations in d3. Constructed the first visualization looking at the countries that produce the best wines on the global scale.

Worked with Bryson to create the presentation.
After receiving feedback for the project, added tooltip to visualization 1. Added force simulation to the points, a tool tip, and a grid to visualization 3. Updated the website with the new visualizations.  

Bryson: Constructed the last visualization looking specifically at Texas wineries. Worked with Heather to create the first draft of the bar graph. Constructed bits of the website.
