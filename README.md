Heather: Cleaned all of the data in R in preparation to create the visualizations in d3. Constructed the first visualization looking at the countries that produce the best wines on the global scale. Worked with Bryson to create the first draft of the bar graph. After receiving early feedback, turn it into a dynamic, user oriented, bar graph looking at Points vs Price in states in the United States of America. Constructed the majority of the website.  
After receiving feedback for the project, added tooltip to the first visualization. Added force simulation to the points, a tool tip, and a grid to the third visualization. Updated the website with the new visualizations.  
Worked with Bryson to create the presentation.  
Revised and edited the paper about the project.  
Created and recorded the final video for the project.
