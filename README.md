Heather: Constructed the first visualization looking at the countries that produce the best wines on the global scale. Worked with Bryson to take the first draft of the bar graph and turn it into a dynamic, user oriented, bar graph looking at Points vs Price in states in the United States of America. Constructed the majority of the website.
After receiving feedback:  
Added tooltip to visualization 1. Added force and a tool tip to visualization 3. Updated the website with the new visualizations.  

Bryson: Constructed the last visualization looking specifically at Texas wineries. Worked with Heather to create the first draft of the bar graph. Constructed bits of the website. Provided lots of helpful feedback for both the website and visualizations as they were being constructed. Worked with Damion on final paper regarding the project.  

Damion: Worked with Bryson to add tooltip for wineries in last visualization. Worked with Bryson on final paper regarding the project.
